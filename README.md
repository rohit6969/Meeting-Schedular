The dashboard composes the above features. The group-box holds the questions, combo-box holds the module and the multiline textbox displays the stories. The saved values are loaded via button Load while on clicking Save, we can save our appropriate module and story. By clicking next, we move to another story with different questions. Also for verification we tend to enter username just to make sure accurate values are returned.

The fields question and story appear as per user interest. On selecting the checkbox Question, text box of question appears. Similarly, on selecting story module and story appear respectively. On choosing both, both of the fields appear correspondingly.
